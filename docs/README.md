# Thunder Dynamics Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Thunder Dynamics.

## Overview

Thunder Dynamics is a C++ framework designed to automatically generate efficient C++ and Python code for the dynamics and control of serial robotic manipulators. It leverages the [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) library for symbolic computation and code generation, using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention for robot parameterization.

The core workflow involves:
1.  Defining your robot's kinematics (DH parameters) and dynamics (inertial parameters) in a YAML configuration file.
2.  Optionally writing custom functions in C++ that can be called from the generated library.
3.  Using the `thunder` command-line tool to process this YAML file.
4.  Generating a dedicated C++ library (`thunder_<robot>`) and optionally Python bindings, containing optimized functions for kinematics, dynamics, regressors, and custom computations.

## Key Components

*   **`thunder`**: The core engine that parses the robot configuration, performs symbolic computations using CasADi, and generates the robot-specific library. It includes modules for standard kinematics, dynamics, and regressor calculations.
*   **`thunder_robot`**: A wrapper class generated for each specific robot, providing a user-friendly C++ and/or Python interface to the low-level functions generated by CasADi.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

*   **[Installation](./installation.md)**: How to set up Thunder Dynamics using Docker or on your host machine.
*   **[Configuration](./configuration.md)**: Detailed explanation of the robot YAML configuration file format.
*   **[Getting Started](./getting_started.md)**: A quick guide to generating your first robot library.
